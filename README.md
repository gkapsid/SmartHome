Smart home documentation and files

This file contains info about the smart home project I implemented.
The project includes:
An app for android device
Software for the arduino Leonardo + Ethernet shield
Schematics for the required hardware

## The Android App
The application for the android device is used for three purposes:
To control two external devices (electrical appliances like light, coffee machine etc.).
To get a measurement from a sensor, that for the moment is a thermometer.
The app is based on code found in:
http://www.greeceandroid.gr/dev/671-smart-home-android-arduino-12
The environment used for the code development was the ECLIPSE Platform
The code was in some point old so the complete updated code can be found in the file FILENAME.js
